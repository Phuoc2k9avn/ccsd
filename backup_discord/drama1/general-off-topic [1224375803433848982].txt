[30/04/2024 20:52] saul.steveyman
you are giving me evidence right here


[30/04/2024 20:53] melonaddict
how? i'd like to see your thought process to interpret an array of words and letters into indicators of a 4chan user?


[30/04/2024 20:54] saul.steveyman
as you can see, you talk like a 4chan nerd
> you have not yet proven sufficient authority to barricade me from the action


[30/04/2024 20:54] melonaddict
the only solid evidence is
https://telehack.com/u/suika


[30/04/2024 20:55] melonaddict
the way you use perfectly mastering Discord markdowns also prove you are a full time basement dweller and Discord mod


[30/04/2024 20:55] melonaddict
The stats come from your online activity


[30/04/2024 20:55] melonaddict
And based on your past messages in the main server


[30/04/2024 20:56] melonaddict

markdown was a thing before discord existed


[30/04/2024 20:57] melonaddict
Discord markdown is a thing. Also this doesn't reconcile with my point


[30/04/2024 20:59] saul.steveyman
oh and you use incredibly professional english words which prove you are a nerd and reminds me of the "i bet you can't make a sentence without the letter A" video


[30/04/2024 20:59] melonaddict
bet


[30/04/2024 21:00] melonaddict
sure thing, it doesn't include the first letter in english lexicon


[30/04/2024 21:00] saul.steveyman
unfortunately mr 4chan nerd user you do not have sufficient evidence to prove that


[30/04/2024 21:01] melonaddict

[30/04/2024 21:10] melonaddict
doesn't relate to 4chan


[02/05/2024 10:19] saul.steveyman
okay sure but, do i care?


[02/05/2024 10:20] saul.steveyman

[10/05/2024 10:28] saul.steveyman
so yeah tortoise is pro-ptd


[10/05/2024 10:30] casio2009
i already know that


[10/05/2024 10:31] casio2009
because ILT considered PTD as his favourite speller student


[10/05/2024 10:31] casio2009
since ptd learning spell 4-lines lowercase with Cache Area


[10/05/2024 10:31] casio2009
that's why ILT **always** on ptd side


[10/05/2024 10:41] saul.steveyman
he dont even believe that happysheep actually hate ptd


[10/05/2024 10:46] apple1835
bcz ptd gives him monkey too üòÜ


[10/05/2024 10:58] saul.steveyman
but ptd dont give him any roles in his server...hmm


[10/05/2024 11:00] apple1835
roles are useless :vv


[10/05/2024 11:14] saul.steveyman
nah pretty much every role on ptd server unlocks channels and/or extra perms


[10/05/2024 11:26] casio2009
yea


[10/05/2024 11:27] casio2009
role in ptd is not actually useless like you think


[10/05/2024 11:33] apple1835
ilt dont need that lol:vv


[10/05/2024 11:34] apple1835
he needs support with spelling or what?


[10/05/2024 11:36] saul.steveyman
he can be a supporter :v


[10/05/2024 11:37] apple1835

so giving hieuxyz admin was a terrible idea


[12/05/2024 11:32] saul.steveyman
he started changing perms


[12/05/2024 11:32] saul.steveyman
without my consent


[12/05/2024 11:33] saul.steveyman
and also chatting vietnamese in bot-error channel (which has no `-vietnamese` suffix)


[12/05/2024 11:34] saul.steveyman
and also add his favorite coding pal


[12/05/2024 11:34] saul.steveyman

[12/05/2024 11:38] saul.steveyman
w/o my consent


[12/05/2024 11:42] hieuxyz
I gave caophihung permission to access the error bot to ask for errors


[12/05/2024 11:43] saul.steveyman

[12/05/2024 11:44] hieuxyz

[15/05/2024 22:58] saul.steveyman
you will get jailed :)


[16/05/2024 11:42] casiohacker
hieuxyz is a good guy he should get admin ~~but i should have instead of him~~


[16/05/2024 11:43] casiohacker
i vote yes


[16/05/2024 11:48] saul.steveyman
thats...not a valid reason


[16/05/2024 11:49] casiohacker
hes active


[16/05/2024 11:49] casiohacker
hes made good bots


[16/05/2024 11:49] casiohacker
ummm'


[16/05/2024 11:50] casiohacker
i mean i dont see the difference between admin and mod


[16/05/2024 11:50] saul.steveyman
admin is super op


[16/05/2024 11:51] saul.steveyman
they can manage the server


[16/05/2024 11:51] saul.steveyman
add any bot they like (even bots that server owner may not like)


[16/05/2024 11:52] saul.steveyman
its basically the wild west


[16/05/2024 11:52] saul.steveyman
very dangerous


[16/05/2024 11:53] saul.steveyman
hieuxyz **CAN'T** get admin, even with the poll saying he should


[16/05/2024 11:54] hieuxyz
:cooleyebrowraise:


[16/05/2024 11:56] casiohacker
if he cant get it that measn i can becasue if 1 is not 0 then 0 is 0


[16/05/2024 12:24] yoshi_1fff000
Is that self promotion to a extent?


[16/05/2024 12:25] yoshi_1fff000
More like unrelated things


[16/05/2024 12:26] yoshi_1fff000
When hieuxyz cant get admin it does NOT affect how or why you could or could not get admin


[16/05/2024 15:30] casiohacker
stevey do you think my bot can be on main server regardless of "status"


[16/05/2024 15:30] saul.steveyman

[17/05/2024 18:03] saul.steveyman

[17/05/2024 18:05] luminolity
hes your mate lmao


[17/05/2024 18:15] casiohacker

[17/05/2024 18:22] luminolity
tortoise..of course


[17/05/2024 18:22] saul.steveyman
he's my classmate, but he's not my *mate* anymore


[17/05/2024 18:23] saul.steveyman
i hate him now


[17/05/2024 18:26] luminolity
but... hes not defending ptd


[17/05/2024 18:26] luminolity
he doesn't like wars


[17/05/2024 18:27] saul.steveyman
you sure about that?


[17/05/2024 18:28] saul.steveyman
his server has "no toxic with anyone **including ptd**" rule


[17/05/2024 18:28] saul.steveyman
and also he say "i accept ptd is toxic" but dont ban ptd


[17/05/2024 18:29] saul.steveyman
these are massive red flags


[17/05/2024 18:56] casio2009
Easy


[17/05/2024 18:56] casio2009
because Tortoises is gay


[17/05/2024 18:56] casio2009
ü§£


[17/05/2024 18:57] casio2009
prove me wrong


[17/05/2024 19:03] luminolity
I think you, many guys or even you are still toxic


[17/05/2024 19:03] luminolity
but why ban him


[17/05/2024 19:04] luminolity
I still not understand


[17/05/2024 19:05] casio2009
Me just send a bit NSFW in tortoises's server and he banned me


[17/05/2024 19:05] casio2009
ban like no mercy


[17/05/2024 19:06] casiohacker
stevey you should explain more


[17/05/2024 19:08] apple1835
ptd gives tortoise money so tortoise is in ptd side


[17/05/2024 19:08] casiohacker
ptd says he will give money but eventually wont


[17/05/2024 19:08] casiohacker
is my guess


[17/05/2024 19:09] apple1835
anyway tortoise is in ptd side


[17/05/2024 19:09] saul.steveyman
no, its because tortoise taught ptd


[17/05/2024 19:09] apple1835
ye so he's in ptd side lol xd?


[17/05/2024 19:09] apple1835
that makes no sense


[17/05/2024 19:09] saul.steveyman
he even defended ptd during the initial server raid


[17/05/2024 19:10] saul.steveyman
and ptd repeatedly use tortoise to say that his business is not illegal


[17/05/2024 19:10] casio2009
yea


[17/05/2024 19:10] casio2009
that was stupid


[17/05/2024 19:11] casiohacker
and stevey on his server i couldnt find ptd tho, confused me


[17/05/2024 19:11] saul.steveyman
even if tortoise did actually grant him permission, it still doesn't mean that the ppl who created spelling granted him permission


[17/05/2024 19:11] saul.steveyman
`xGreen`


[17/05/2024 19:11] apple1835
he's xGreen


[17/05/2024 19:11] casiohacker
yes i couldnt find him


[17/05/2024 19:11] casio2009
i think he renamed


[17/05/2024 19:11] casiohacker
he has same role as me "gardian of excelence"


[17/05/2024 19:11] saul.steveyman
try searching `from:623382102385229864`


[17/05/2024 19:11] casiohacker
but he has nitro so can change server profile completely

[17/05/2024 19:12] casio2009
"the facter"?


[17/05/2024 19:12] casio2009
what is that role?


[17/05/2024 19:12] casiohacker
probably higher rank


[17/05/2024 19:13] apple1835
ptd is tortoise's student not friend


[17/05/2024 19:13] apple1835

The Discord Update of all time...
Discord has revolutionized the internet. Gone are the days of Discord bots. Welcome to the era of Discord apps.

The Great Filter theory is an interesting theory. It is the hypothesis that there exists a barrier that is preventing technological civilizations from becoming interplanetary, and this barrier is known as the Great Filter. This hypothesis is the result of the Fermi Paradox, which wonders why, if there are so many planets in the observable universe, we have not encountered any other life in the universe yet. The Great Filter is a possible explanation of this.
I believe that the self-destructive nature of curious and intelligent beings developing technologies such as us humans could be confirming Great Filter.

What did it exactly violate


[21/05/2024 19:17] saul.steveyman
"Any blacklist or feature enable/disable commands need to be usable by server administrators and moderators"


[21/05/2024 19:18] yoshi_1fff000
Ok


[21/05/2024 19:21] yoshi_1fff000
You only modeled on 1 sample


[21/05/2024 19:22] yoshi_1fff000
Did you ever talked to other tlh users


[21/05/2024 19:22] yoshi_1fff000
(i do not support suika ofc)


[21/05/2024 19:23] saul.steveyman
whatever


[21/05/2024 20:27] casiohacker
im in off topic


[21/05/2024 20:27] casiohacker
now


[21/05/2024 20:27] casiohacker
where is all the stuff people are talking about like stevey said?


[21/05/2024 20:27] saul.steveyman
its in jail


[21/05/2024 20:28] unegoist
jail


[21/05/2024 20:28] saul.steveyman
but you cant access jail


[21/05/2024 20:28] saul.steveyman
so


[21/05/2024 20:28] casiohacker
oh i dont have in my channel list


[21/05/2024 20:28] saul.steveyman
you're not a mod and ur not jailed


[21/05/2024 20:28] saul.steveyman
so


[21/05/2024 20:28] casiohacker
then what do you want me to do?


[21/05/2024 20:28] saul.steveyman
you can talk here


[21/05/2024 20:28] casiohacker
ok


[21/05/2024 20:28] casiohacker
im talking here


[21/05/2024 20:29] unegoist
totalynce we and caophihung spam on that server together so


[21/05/2024 20:30] casiohacker
btw for anyone else who ask if i volunteer to spam tortise, is i said i hae power so i can mess up, stevey said to make a ptd = stupid channel and told me to say like ptd is scammer so i did @ everyone ping and server link for extra, stevey did not ask me to do that but i wanted to regardless, myintentions where to spam from the start, stevey kinda just told me how to do it (kinda)


[21/05/2024 20:30] casiohacker
and that was covered in stevey video


[21/05/2024 20:31] casiohacker
so stevey video = correct


[21/05/2024 20:31] unegoist
but the idea to spam tortoise server is not a good idea


[21/05/2024 20:31] casiohacker
well tortise is ptdefender, ptdefender = bad bad = spam


[21/05/2024 20:31] casiohacker
is what im thinking


[21/05/2024 20:32] unegoist
you cant just spam someone server for reason there is someone in that server that everyone despises


[21/05/2024 20:32] unegoist
it's not ideal


[21/05/2024 20:32] casiohacker
no like ilt is a defender


[21/05/2024 20:32] unegoist
you see how many negative attention have been turned to our side?


[21/05/2024 20:33] casiohacker
or someone tell me why not


[21/05/2024 20:33] unegoist
yes, i know that he is a defender, but by using the @ everyone tag you disrupt innocent in that server


[21/05/2024 20:33] unegoist
*innocents


[21/05/2024 20:34] unegoist
also ptd can use that reason to antagonize us


[21/05/2024 20:34] casiohacker
innocents, shouldnt be in defender server


[21/05/2024 20:34] casiohacker
bracuse, what is there to gain?


[21/05/2024 20:34] casiohacker
or would tortise fan be in there not in cch


[21/05/2024 20:35] unegoist
people who watch tortoise videos and mind their business?


[21/05/2024 20:36] casiohacker
ok


[21/05/2024 20:36] unegoist
i cant change your opinion


[21/05/2024 20:36] unegoist
but


[21/05/2024 20:36] casiohacker
then, any negative from that should be put towards me and not anyone else, as they were not part of it


[21/05/2024 20:36] unegoist
there is real consequence


[21/05/2024 20:37] unegoist
***me and caophihung were involved in it***, its not like entirely your fault


[21/05/2024 20:37] unegoist
i just realized my fault, thats all


[21/05/2024 20:38] casiohacker
well no need to fell bad, if people are too lazy to mute a server, why wouyld they get angry? the messsage was targetted to ptdefender and ptd himself so they should help by targetting them instead as they are the bad guys


[21/05/2024 20:39] casiohacker
also the reason why id dint delete any of the main channels, as that would be cruel


[21/05/2024 20:39] unegoist
do they want to participate when they got stuff to do


[21/05/2024 20:39] unegoist
well that makes sense


[21/05/2024 20:40] casiohacker
mute server is really simple, please do it if you dont want ping, so if you can mute server, why get angry?


[21/05/2024 20:40] casiohacker
idk what the people are saying so you can dm me if you ahve any question


[21/05/2024 20:44] unegoist
people are lazy bro what do you think, sometimes they're busy as i had said, they dont care for the mute thing


[21/05/2024 20:44] unegoist
also phone


[21/05/2024 20:44] unegoist
fuck phoen


[21/05/2024 20:44] saul.steveyman
just


[21/05/2024 20:44] saul.steveyman
DND


[21/05/2024 20:44] saul.steveyman
and turn off mobile push notifications


[21/05/2024 20:44] unegoist
but in the moral obligation is spamming a sv with conditions like i had said above


[21/05/2024 20:45] unegoist
is that moral?


[21/05/2024 20:45] unegoist
# is that moral?


[21/05/2024 20:45] saul.steveyman
i mean yeah you can say no, but i thought tortoise had spam channel? why cant tortoise just say "hey bro, move to spam-a-tortoise"


[21/05/2024 20:46] casiohacker
eh @ptd-is-fatso is better


[21/05/2024 20:46] casiohacker
later changed to ptd is scammer as it was deleteed


[21/05/2024 20:46] unegoist
# BRO WE WAS LITERALLY SPAMMING IN THE GENERAL


[21/05/2024 20:46] saul.steveyman

[21/05/2024 20:47] casiohacker

[21/05/2024 20:49] unegoist
*here


[21/05/2024 20:50] saul.steveyman

[21/05/2024 20:50] unegoist
you kind of ***abuse-modded*** this sv


[21/05/2024 20:50] unegoist
did you think of the results that would comes out of this?


[21/05/2024 20:51] casiohacker
nah im pretty bad at things lke that


[21/05/2024 20:51] saul.steveyman
its just what i do


[21/05/2024 20:51] saul.steveyman
ptdefenders i punish


[21/05/2024 20:51] saul.steveyman
tortoise defenders = ptdefender defenders


[21/05/2024 20:51] unegoist
what if they were just like me saying stuff like this


[21/05/2024 20:52] unegoist
what if they were that one guy who wrote a paragraph in the CCH server


[21/05/2024 20:52] casiohacker
what was the paragraph?


[21/05/2024 20:52] saul.steveyman
the big paragraph


[21/05/2024 20:52] saul.steveyman
from ptd alt


[21/05/2024 20:53] saul.steveyman
then i also punish


[21/05/2024 20:53] casiohacker
link to the message?


[21/05/2024 20:53] unegoist
the response and theoretical solution and you did it well in this sv

[21/05/2024 20:54] casiohacker
oh that one


[21/05/2024 20:54] unegoist
you created this sv to give a big fuck you to ptd and why would you have to be so dictatorial like ptd


[21/05/2024 20:54] casiohacker
~~new theory: steveyboi si actually putin~~


[21/05/2024 20:54] unegoist
if i wasnt too much active on two servers i would have been banned, liek the previous incident


[21/05/2024 20:56] unegoist
so you couldnt really handle negative responses


[21/05/2024 20:57] saul.steveyman
i may not be autistic, but i feel like... its the gen z norm


[21/05/2024 20:58] unegoist
gen z norm??? its not, people with egotism traits is always hated


[21/05/2024 20:58] unegoist
like ok maybe its uncontrollable


[21/05/2024 20:59] unegoist
but like we feel your egotism is too large


[21/05/2024 20:59] casiohacker
~~beubeu is autistic, got it~~


[21/05/2024 20:59] casiohacker
i dont


[21/05/2024 21:00] saul.steveyman
so in the end https://canary.discord.com/channels/1224374441375563826/1224375080289570938/1242467822240661566


[21/05/2024 21:01] unegoist
let people see the jail channel


[21/05/2024 21:01] unegoist
and see how people react


[21/05/2024 21:01] unegoist
to your dictatorship


[21/05/2024 21:01] unegoist
think of the consequences


[21/05/2024 21:01] saul.steveyman
that would not be """real""" jail


[21/05/2024 21:02] unegoist
***people can visit jail without saying anything***


[21/05/2024 21:02] unegoist
no sending messages if no jailed perm


[21/05/2024 21:02] saul.steveyman
that would still not really be real jail


[21/05/2024 21:03] saul.steveyman
obviously i can't make it like 100% real jail


[21/05/2024 21:03] saul.steveyman
in real jail, ig you can visit inmates


[21/05/2024 21:03] unegoist
yeah??? you could do that why not here


[21/05/2024 21:03] saul.steveyman
but you're probably not allowed to overhear inmates' conversations


[21/05/2024 21:04] casiohacker
üíÄthis is becoming an rp now


[21/05/2024 21:04] saul.steveyman
here its the same, you're not allowed to read conversations in jail channel


[21/05/2024 21:04] unegoist
ok not the rp stuff, this isnt ***real*** stevey its the internet


[21/05/2024 21:04] unegoist
discord isnt real


[21/05/2024 21:05] saul.steveyman
i like to make it feel real


[21/05/2024 21:05] saul.steveyman
ik its not real


[21/05/2024 21:07] unegoist
but why only jail have realism, this isnt a country or province that youre managing


[21/05/2024 21:07] saul.steveyman
technically you can say it is one


[21/05/2024 21:08] unegoist
no it isnt


[21/05/2024 21:08] unegoist
its a community


[21/05/2024 21:08] unegoist
not a fucking country


[21/05/2024 21:08] saul.steveyman
a country has a community


[21/05/2024 21:09] unegoist
this is a small community what would you expect


[21/05/2024 21:09] saul.steveyman
IRL you'd have a small country


[21/05/2024 21:09] unegoist
a community on a disk space on a server somewhere


[21/05/2024 21:09] unegoist
managed by a operator somewhere


[21/05/2024 21:10] unegoist
haizz


[21/05/2024 21:10] unegoist
are you trying to avoid opening jail


[21/05/2024 21:10] saul.steveyman
i will never open jail


[21/05/2024 21:10] unegoist
oh i see


[21/05/2024 21:10] unegoist
youll never open jail


[21/05/2024 21:11] saul.steveyman
publicly


[21/05/2024 21:11] unegoist
what are you scared of by opening jail


[21/05/2024 21:11] unegoist
if jailed members can talk and the public cannot


[21/05/2024 21:12] saul.steveyman
imagine IRL if visitors can overhear inmates' conversations they might agree with what the inmates are saying and then in the future do something bad


[21/05/2024 21:12] casiohacker
can i see atleast then?


[21/05/2024 21:13] saul.steveyman
its full of vietnamese


[21/05/2024 21:13] unegoist
but like i said this isnt a real space


[21/05/2024 21:13] saul.steveyman
no buts


[21/05/2024 21:13] unegoist
yes buts


[21/05/2024 21:13] unegoist
rebuttals are real mind you


[21/05/2024 21:15] casiohacker
can you tell me overall what they say?


[21/05/2024 21:16] unegoist
stevey's personality -> the fate of ccs+d server


[21/05/2024 21:22] saul.steveyman
tbh the vietnam CCH community is just completely in pieces at this point

no


[21/05/2024 21:22] saul.steveyman
it was already shit even before ptd


[21/05/2024 21:23] apple1835
ptd start in september 2023 lol


[21/05/2024 21:24] saul.steveyman
the tiktok stolen content problem is like a common thing in vietnam


[21/05/2024 21:24] unegoist
stevey why are you still like not jailing me or sth


[21/05/2024 21:25] unegoist
i thought that i would have been jailed


[21/05/2024 21:25] unegoist
im too tired to trying messaging at this point


[21/05/2024 21:25] casiohacker
but  stevey you are doing things wrong, maybe make some tut on your yt and netaro had some good points so just think about on what could be change


[21/05/2024 21:26] casiohacker
otherwize, your all good


[21/05/2024 21:26] unegoist
respond bro


[21/05/2024 21:26] apple1835
and now you make it worse üíÄ


[21/05/2024 21:27] saul.steveyman
is there really nothing we can do about the vietnamese CCH community?


[21/05/2024 21:27] casiohacker
well idk vn so i only know like 1/8th of what is going on


[21/05/2024 21:27] unegoist
but nothing really changed from when you created this server to today?


[21/05/2024 21:27] apple1835
wow ur gud


[21/05/2024 21:27] unegoist
until today


[21/05/2024 21:27] unegoist
?


[21/05/2024 21:27] saul.steveyman
uh yes things did change


[21/05/2024 21:28] apple1835
tks for knowing our country xDD


[21/05/2024 21:28] unegoist
things improved for a start


[21/05/2024 21:28] casiohacker
vn cch is where the most people are coming from but they are all spread around, i think just having 1 server is good enough like child servers should be moved back into cch


[21/05/2024 21:28] casiohacker
or seperate vn server


[21/05/2024 21:28] casiohacker
thats my idea


[21/05/2024 21:28] saul.steveyman
seperation is splitting up the community


[21/05/2024 21:29] saul.steveyman
this is what ptd does though


[21/05/2024 21:29] saul.steveyman
beubeu also hates ptd for community seperation


[21/05/2024 21:29] casiohacker
so what my idea in cch was to rename to cch internatinal because of everyone


[21/05/2024 21:29] apple1835
why beubeu here again .-.


[21/05/2024 21:29] casiohacker
maybe make cch more internatinal


[21/05/2024 21:30] saul.steveyman
i have to bring him up since he is the owner of casio calculator hacking server


[21/05/2024 21:31] unegoist
ok so we all agree ptd is bad


[21/05/2024 21:31] unegoist
but


[21/05/2024 21:31] apple1835
we should creat a server for vietnamese


[21/05/2024 21:31] unegoist
but


[21/05/2024 21:31] unegoist
why the self-seperation here


[21/05/2024 21:31] apple1835
foreign can join


[21/05/2024 21:31] saul.steveyman
and not understand absolutely anything


[21/05/2024 21:31] apple1835
cuz each country has diffirent type of calculator


[21/05/2024 21:32] saul.steveyman
which is why i made this server english and vietnamese


[21/05/2024 21:32] unegoist
??????????????????????????


[21/05/2024 21:32] apple1835
not much vietnamese will interested in 991cnx or smth


[21/05/2024 21:32] apple1835
they dont care


[21/05/2024 21:32] casiohacker
ok idk whats happinging now i gotta sleep


[21/05/2024 21:32] casiohacker
gn


[21/05/2024 21:33] saul.steveyman
lots of community seperation going on which beubeu doesnt agree with


[21/05/2024 21:33] apple1835
bruh why they are even here :v


[21/05/2024 21:33] casiohacker
they are ere to learn


[21/05/2024 21:33] saul.steveyman
for boosting the server count ig :)))


[21/05/2024 21:33] apple1835
why do we have to care about beubeu


[21/05/2024 21:33] casiohacker
if they dont learn they observer


[21/05/2024 21:33] apple1835
we can creat myself


[21/05/2024 21:33] unegoist
ok will you @Steveyboi release the bois


[21/05/2024 21:33] saul.steveyman

[21/05/2024 21:35] unegoist
stevey


[21/05/2024 21:35] saul.steveyman

[21/05/2024 21:36] unegoist
no end this drama for once by jailing me because i cant convince you


[21/05/2024 21:36] unegoist
i have other things to do

[21/05/2024 21:38] saul.steveyman

[21/05/2024 21:38] unegoist
nah


[21/05/2024 21:38] unegoist
i love this sv the most


[21/05/2024 21:39] saul.steveyman
i think you're just gonna end up chatting more in jail


[21/05/2024 21:39] casiohacker
ok stevey, what would happen if we let ptd do his thing, eventually they will look towards ptd, but why can we keep cch just like a hoby thing, becuase people who are getting scammed cant be up to us as we cant really do anything about it anymore, so if people come to our server and try to shame us just kick them or ban them no explination becuase i thinkit should just be a place to share and invent develop or ddiscover nothing else


[21/05/2024 21:39] saul.steveyman
hmm


[21/05/2024 21:39] saul.steveyman
well


[21/05/2024 21:39] saul.steveyman

[21/05/2024 21:40] saul.steveyman

[25/05/2024 08:27] saul.steveyman
knew it üî•üî•üî•üî•


[25/05/2024 08:27] saul.steveyman
tortoise might send it to ptd to sell


[25/05/2024 08:32] saul.steveyman
we are in a world where nothing is original


[25/05/2024 08:32] saul.steveyman
and everyone has wrong beliefs


[25/05/2024 08:33] saul.steveyman
casio2009 did not *create* quickcpy and tetris and hex editor


[25/05/2024 08:34] saul.steveyman
yet he says i have "power illusion", imo i think he has "power illusion"


[25/05/2024 08:35] saul.steveyman
he says i'm autistic, i think he is austistic


[25/05/2024 08:36] saul.steveyman
someone having an impolite behavior towards people they hate is definitely a bull headed kid


[25/05/2024 08:37] saul.steveyman
when i FORGOT to unblock him he didnt say to beubeu "uhh no he hasn't unblocked me" but he says "HE IS A LIAR"


[25/05/2024 08:38] saul.steveyman
bro is also splitting up the community


[25/05/2024 08:39] saul.steveyman
now there are like 7 servers related to casio calculator hacking, only 3 are from the main community, the remaining 4 are from ptd, tortoise and their defenders


[25/05/2024 08:42] saul.steveyman
to sum it up, casio calculator hacking community is now split into 2
- main community
- ptd/tortoise community


[25/05/2024 08:47] saul.steveyman
i can rant about k9 all day, if you want to hear more feel free to DM me (please be polite)


[25/05/2024 08:47] saul.steveyman

[25/05/2024 11:46] kien9811
he did not create but he translated it and made guides for everyone can understand and do the hacking ?


[25/05/2024 11:47] kien9811
and had xyzst‚Äôs permission


[25/05/2024 11:48] casiohacker
yes, anyone can translate and create guide but never take credit


[25/05/2024 11:48] casiohacker
also translating is really easy just tedius


[25/05/2024 11:49] kien9811
let take an example : Why we even need teacher while the knowledge is everwhere


[25/05/2024 11:50] kien9811
just make sure he create it and all solved . (not mention ptd here)


[25/05/2024 11:52] kien9811
and why school is found .we pay money for school to receive the knowledge
they summarize all thing and connect it to the basic thing 
explain to us how to do it


[25/05/2024 11:53] kien9811
k9 is the same 
he like a teacher for us


[25/05/2024 11:53] kien9811
i know some teacher just teach for the dream and dont need money
but nowadays it‚Äôs not popular


[25/05/2024 11:54] saul.steveyman
okay okay i know he's a teacher alright


[25/05/2024 11:54] saul.steveyman
but that's not the real problem


[25/05/2024 11:54] saul.steveyman
the real problem is that he is toxic towards people he doesn't like


[25/05/2024 11:54] casiohacker
having a person to create guides is useful to new people, just stay nice to everyone is what i like


[25/05/2024 11:55] saul.steveyman
i would say that is discrimination


[25/05/2024 11:55] saul.steveyman
only bull headed kid would do so


[25/05/2024 11:57] kien9811
maybe cuz the vnese community is toxic


[25/05/2024 11:57] saul.steveyman
yeah, vietnamese kids love to learn how to "talk like a vietnamese" thru tiktok


[25/05/2024 11:58] casiohacker
tiktokis runngpeople


[25/05/2024 11:58] saul.steveyman
vietnamese swearing is the worst type of swear i have ever heard, which is why i banned it from this server


[25/05/2024 12:01] kien9811
totally . some problem happened recently is about money and copyright
k9 he have done many thing and he just 15 now so his psychology is affected that he want the power for the things he did


[25/05/2024 12:01] kien9811
to the community


[25/05/2024 12:01] kien9811
and have no thanks


[25/05/2024 12:02] kien9811
or **money**


[25/05/2024 12:02] kien9811
to admit his


[25/05/2024 12:02] saul.steveyman
so basically, you're saying k9 is autistic?


[25/05/2024 12:04] kien9811
both of you are wrong 
just have some talk


[25/05/2024 12:05] kien9811
stevey
couple of day ago . i even thought you was kiddo


[25/05/2024 12:05] saul.steveyman
k9 is not even polite when talking to me


[25/05/2024 12:06] casiohacker
he will grow up when he grows up irl i think


[25/05/2024 12:06] casiohacker
tik tok users are often toxic


[25/05/2024 12:07] kien9811
=)) just make an patreon and everything can be solved


[25/05/2024 12:08] kien9811
just pay money for the leader and co-leader for the work they have done to the community


[25/05/2024 12:08] saul.steveyman
CCH community is non profit, no one is making money or giving away money
ptd community is another story


[25/05/2024 12:09] saul.steveyman
ptd community is centered around money, capitalism and power


[25/05/2024 12:09] kien9811
and technically that why k9 out
just he have done so much thing but in his mind , he didnt received anything


[25/05/2024 12:10] saul.steveyman
he did


[25/05/2024 12:10] saul.steveyman
he recieved love from the community


[25/05/2024 12:10] saul.steveyman
but in his mind, he wants more than just love


[25/05/2024 12:10] kien9811
ptd just an business man
you know edison . father of light bulb ? . He even bought the invention of someone and make the copyright to him


[25/05/2024 12:11] kien9811
=)) no one just want love , doesnt it


[25/05/2024 12:11] kien9811
you do the job hard but dont received salary


[25/05/2024 12:11] kien9811
haha hurt


[25/05/2024 12:12] casiohacker
yeayh but ptd did not buy he stole...


[25/05/2024 12:12] saul.steveyman
i like being a freelancer


[25/05/2024 12:12] saul.steveyman
i'm not motivated by money


[25/05/2024 12:12] saul.steveyman
i'm motivated by the mysteries of casio calculators and the obscure architecture they use


[25/05/2024 12:12] kien9811
cause there is no copyright first 
you just public and someone take it easily


[25/05/2024 12:13] saul.steveyman
iirc spelling was first posted on baidu tieba


[25/05/2024 12:13] kien9811
so your opinion is different from many people


[25/05/2024 12:13] casiohacker
-_-


[25/05/2024 12:13] kien9811
when become adult
money is much beter


[25/05/2024 12:14] saul.steveyman
tieba agreement

[25/05/2024 12:15] kien9811
in the past : you‚Äô were teached money is all . but now is different . without money . ton of things is very hard


[25/05/2024 12:16] saul.steveyman
obviously, there are lots of other legitimate ways to make money


[25/05/2024 12:16] saul.steveyman
i think making money from casio calculator hacking videos is fine


[25/05/2024 12:16] saul.steveyman
but selling casio calculator hacking docs is not


[25/05/2024 12:17] saul.steveyman
likewise hosting CCH competition with money prize is also not fine


[25/05/2024 12:18] kien9811
just think . you re the leader of the community 
find the best solution to solve the problem


[25/05/2024 12:18] kien9811
k9 he‚Äôs the best here


[25/05/2024 12:19] saul.steveyman
no one is truly the leader of the community


[25/05/2024 12:19] kien9811
technically you‚Äôre


[25/05/2024 12:20] saul.steveyman
no one is willing to call themselves "the leader of the casio calculator hacking community"


[25/05/2024 12:20] kien9811
without him
our working are slower


[25/05/2024 12:22] bacteria2331
maybe both of you are


[25/05/2024 12:23] casiohacker
üíÄ i think hosting a translation comp is fine, jsut credit the original creator, a reward is not buying but congratulating i think


[25/05/2024 12:25] kien9811
society ‚Äòs another story 
you think just congratulate and k9 do the work more. nah


[25/05/2024 12:27] kien9811
like the kid 
firstkid need congratulation to be obedient and sth like get good mark
but later he need more like a gift


[25/05/2024 12:29] unegoist
But not by manipulating kids


[25/05/2024 12:29] unegoist
Also when tf will we do the tetris thing


[25/05/2024 12:32] kien9811
wdym


[25/05/2024 17:09] casiohacker
message to all people who think that taking and selling xyzst rop is ok becuase "its public" is wrong, he uploads to baiudu first whichgives all the rights to the author of the message of the actuall creator kinda thing, also xyzst, continue uploading to baidu first then us ok? got that stupid nitwits?


[25/05/2024 17:11] casiohacker
even better, take the emu rom and put into either users or steveys emulator


[25/05/2024 19:14] casiohacker

[28/05/2024 17:05] melonaddict

[28/05/2024 17:05] melonaddict
mf cool


[28/05/2024 17:05] casiohacker
good, but where?


[28/05/2024 17:06] melonaddict
and then scramble it so that other ppl who use the ROP can't remove it


[28/05/2024 17:06] casiohacker
somewhere int he middle


[28/05/2024 17:06] melonaddict
bottom left corner, font 08

[28/05/2024 17:07] melonaddict
... bro not gonna add his mf name into the game


[28/05/2024 17:09] casiohacker
bigger font than the line = character cutt of, means you can get half character mease move down 1 line to drop and you can draw the whole map of tetris just using chars in this way, generate a sires of square and the swaure drop part just check the line below on all of the tile then continue


[28/05/2024 17:09] casiohacker
atlease, if it isnt that, its hgow i would of done it


[28/05/2024 17:09] casiohacker
i suspected this when trying to run in normal font, the map was glitched but the game stioll worked


[28/05/2024 17:09] casiohacker
small font looked correct


[28/05/2024 17:12] casio2009

[30/05/2024 21:11] saul.steveyman
you specifically need 5.3

run `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-lua5.3` (if you use mingw64)

[30/05/2024 21:18] casiohacker

[30/05/2024 21:19] unegoist
modified the install script...


[30/05/2024 21:19] saul.steveyman
wait you installed raw mingw64 or something


[30/05/2024 21:19] unegoist
but errores still occured


[30/05/2024 21:19] unegoist
huh


[30/05/2024 21:20] saul.steveyman
you should have installed msys2


[30/05/2024 21:20] saul.steveyman
which includes mingw64


[30/05/2024 21:20] unegoist
(ping me if any answer or solution)

[30/05/2024 21:24] unegoist
yep errors occured again


[30/05/2024 21:24] unegoist
this time meson python thing


[30/05/2024 21:26] saul.steveyman
`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-meson`


[30/05/2024 21:27] unegoist

```
In the eerie, demon-infested forests of Ohio, a peculiar demon named VyzGyatt terrorized the night. VyzGyatt had mastered a bizarre and powerful breathing technique known as Skibidi Breathing, which allowed him to confuse and disorient his enemies with unpredictable dance moves.

One fateful evening, Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko, and Zenitsu were sent to Ohio to investigate the mysterious disappearances. They stumbled upon VyzGyatt performing the Skibidi dance, his movements creating hypnotic waves that entranced anyone who watched.

Suddenly, a flamboyant warrior named Rizzler appeared, a Hashira renowned for his unparalleled charisma and mastery of Rizz Breathing. Rizzler had heard about the notorious Fanum Tax, a demon curse that forced humans to pay with their souls if they failed to exhibit "sigma" qualities‚Äîbravery, strength, and wit.

Tanjiro and his friends watched in awe as Rizzler faced off against VyzGyatt. Rizzler's First Form: Sigma Rizz created a whirlwind of charm that countered VyzGyatt's Skibidi Breathing. The clash was intense, each movement filled with dazzling absurdity and power.

With a final, dramatic flourish, Rizzler unleashed his ultimate technique: Fanum Tax Redemption. The air shimmered with pure rizz, and VyzGyatt's Skibidi Breathing faltered. Tanjiro seized the moment, using his Water Breathing to deliver a decisive strike.

VyzGyatt, defeated but oddly impressed, vanished into the night, leaving Ohio free from his chaotic influence. The Demon Slayer Corps celebrated their victory with a dance-off led by Rizzler, whose rizz and sigma qualities inspired all.

And so, the legend of the Skibidi-Rizz Breathing techniques spread throughout the land, a testament to the strange and wondrous battles fought in the heart of Ohio.
